### Local Demo

Install webpack global if you don't have it in your system by running this command in a terminal:
```sh
$ npm i webpack -g
```

Thus, cd to the project directory, and run:
```sh
$ npm install
$ webpack --progress [--watch]
```
The first command will install all project dependencies, the second will build the bundle.js starting from app.js file

Now you can open examples/examples1.html file with your favourite browser and watch the react portfolio demo.
